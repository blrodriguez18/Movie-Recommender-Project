# Movie Recommender Project

## DO NOT RUN THE "MOVIE RECOMMENDER" PAGE on the website
### Download all the files in the repository, run the "tfidf.py" to create the required zipped pickle file
### Once the pickle file is created in the same directory as the rest of the files, you can run the website on your local device and the Movie Recommender page should work
